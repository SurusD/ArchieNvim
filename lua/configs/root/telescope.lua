-- Telescope is a fuzzy finder that comes with a lot of different things that
-- it can fuzzy find! It's more than just a "file finder", it can search
-- many different aspects of Neovim, your workspace, LSP, and more!
--
-- The easiest way to use Telescope, is to start by doing something like:
--  :Telescope help_tags
--
-- After running this command, a window will open up and you're able to
-- type in the prompt window. You'll see a list of `help_tags` options and
-- a corresponding preview of the help.
--
-- Two important keymaps to use while in Telescope are:
--  - Insert mode: <c-/>
--  - Normal mode: ?
--
-- This opens a window that shows you all of the keymaps for the current
-- Telescope picker. This is really useful to discover what Telescope can
-- do as well as how to actually do it!

-- [[ Configure Telescope ]]
-- See `:help telescope` and `:help telescope.setup()`
